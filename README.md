# Hi I am Deepraj Baidya😎, a Student DEV..

## Periodic Table Elements--GUI Version 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥..

    - Hi, this is a "Periodic Table" GUI made using Tkinter module of Python..
    - This GUI takes User Input{of elements or symbols} and Returns the other Information of that element.
    
    ▶Hope You'll Like this one.🥰
    ▶Feel Free to contribute.....

### <u>Steps and Module Needed🤩🤩🤩.</u>
  
  1. We need to install Tkinter Library of Python in order to make the GUI
      - In order to install TKinter,first open your CMD or any other Terminal and type **{pip install tk}**. That's it.
        <img src="ter.png">
  2. Now make a list of all the Elements of the Periodic Table in a seperate python file and store them all in a **dictionary**(a data type in python).
        <img src="tableElem.png">

  3. Import the file containing the dictionary of all the     Elements in the main code file.
      - eg-- {from filename.py import *}, which in this case is [elements.py](elements.py)
        <img src="2.png">

  4. Now follow the code i.e-- [table.py](table.py)
